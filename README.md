Shout out to [u/Zero00Shadow](https://www.reddit.com/user/Zero00Shadow) for his extensive testing for performance and battery, etc - results coming soon

I have updated some kexts, and made some light SSDT edits to enable the touch screen and update OC to 0.6.4.
This EFI Has been tested on 10.15.5 - 11.1. I will update/report as I go.

Tweaks for better performance:
 
More natural trackpad: 
`<System Preferences > Trackpad > "Turn off Force Click and haptic Feedback">`

# Things That Work:
* TOUCHSCREEN 4K Display w/ Scaling
* Full 2GB Graphics Acceleration
* Sound / Headphone port / / Mic In
* ALL USB / USB-C ports

* Bluetooth and Wifi (with card seen above)
* Power Management

* Handoff
* Continuity

# Not Working Items:
* Stock BT / WIFI --> could use [OpenIntelWireless kext](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm) but likely won't have ability to get iServices working
* Nvidia 1650 dGPU
* Finger print reader (likely never will)

---
# Buggy at times:
* HDMI hot plugging. Sometimes upon disconnect the laptop thinks that it still has two displays to work with when it doesn't. Simply close the lid and reopen to fix.

# Overall:
Overall this thing is a beast and dual-boots Windows 10 like a champ.
